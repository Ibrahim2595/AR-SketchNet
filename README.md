# AR-SketchNet

ARSketchNet takes a 3D sketch done in AR space using a hand held mobile phone, to predict and reconstruct a mesh of the corresponding sketch that is displayed back into the AR space. The model leverages the complementary affordances of 3D sketching (immersive, unconstrained, life-sized) and pretrained ML models (precise, constrained, ergonomic) interactions and tools for in situ 3D prototyping.
